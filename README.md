# Battleship

In this short demo you can

 1. start the game by choosing either the pirate button or navy button at the bottom to select player 1
 2. choose block renders of ships from the side and select a spot for them to go on the board
 3. click on the currently selected render side-ship to rotate 90 degrees
 4. last night at around 9:30 it all broke, so the other working features are now nonexistant. Sorry! :/



 # actually

 as I was typing this, I clicked on the page to check out how it's functioning. It can't even render the placed blocks anymore. 

 read if you care
1. until 9:00 this morning this demo could
2. select color coded ships to your theme and place them on the grid
3. an indicator highlighting the slot on the grid you were placing your object, as well as the corrosponding divs
4. a clean transition to the shooting phase 

at one point, this demo had

 1. shot functionality and selectable shot types
 2. a hit function that changed the class of ship objects
 3. player objects with ships tied to element classes and IDs to keep track of ships
 4. a check if defeated function in the player objects that assessed their total shipdeath count
 5. ammo for unique shots in player objects

 and now after salvaging it from 9pm till now, it's gone. very poetic
